## **What is Git?**

Git is a **version control system** that helps track changes in your code and facilitates collaboration. It ensures you can work with other developers or save different versions of your project without losing track of changes. Git is essential for any modern programmer, especially when working in teams or on larger projects.

## **Why Do Programmers Use Git?**

Programmers use Git because it:

- Allows **collaboration** on shared projects without overwriting each other's work.
- **Tracks changes** over time, making it easier to identify what has changed and why.
- Supports **branching**, letting developers experiment with new features without affecting the main project.
- Acts as a **backup** for your codebase, with all versions saved securely.
