# C++ Programming Lessons

## Why Learn C++ as Your First Programming Language?

C++ is a foundational programming language that teaches you both high-level and low-level programming concepts. By learning C++, you will:

- Understand the basics of computer science, including memory management and efficient coding.
- Build a strong foundation for learning other programming languages like Python, Java, and JavaScript.
- Develop problem-solving skills by working with algorithms and data structures.

## Recommended Editors

To write and run C++ code, you can use **Dev-C++** or **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** as your editor.

### Why Dev-C++?

- Simple and lightweight IDE.
- Perfect for beginners with built-in features for compiling and running C++ code.
- Easy to install and use without additional configuration.

### Why Visual Studio Code?

- Highly customizable and supports many languages beyond C++.
- A modern text editor with features like IntelliSense, syntax highlighting, and Git integration.
- Ideal for long-term use as you advance to other programming languages.

## How to Configure C++ in VS Code

1. **Install C++ Extension:** Go to the Extensions tab and install the "C/C++" extension by Microsoft.
2. **Install GCC Compiler:**
   - If you're using Windows, download and install MinGW (<https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/>).
   - For macOS/Linux, you can install the `g++` compiler using Homebrew or a package manager like apt.
3. **Configure Build Tasks:**
   - Go to `Terminal -> Configure Default Build Task`.
   - Choose "C++: g++ build active file."
4. **Run Your Code:**
   - Open the terminal and run the command:  

     ```bash
     g++ -o program_name source_file.cpp
     ./program_name
     ```

## Lesson Structure

All lessons are organized into different folders, where each folder represents one lesson. Inside each lesson folder, you'll find two subfolders:

- **Class Work:** Contains code and materials covered during the lesson.
- **Homework:** Contains assignments and exercises you are expected to complete on your own.

### How to Check Lessons

1. Navigate to the lesson folder you want to review.
2. Explore the **Class Work** folder for code examples and topics covered in class.
3. Complete the tasks in the **Homework** folder and submit your solutions.
