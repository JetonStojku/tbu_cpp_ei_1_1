## **Exercise 1: Student Grades**

**Problem Statement:**  
You are given a matrix `grades[n][2]`, where:

- The **first column** stores a student's marks in an exam.
- The **second column** stores the weight (in percentage) of the exam.

Write a program to:

1. Prompt the user to input the number of students (`n`).
2. For each student, enter their marks and the weight of the exam.
3. Calculate and print a summary in tabular format, displaying:
   - Each student's marks, weight, and weighted score (marks × weight / 100).
4. Calculate and display the class average weighted score.

## **Exercise 3: Inventory Management**

**Problem Statement:**  
You are managing a small shop's inventory stored in a matrix `inventory[n][2]`, where:

- The **first column** stores the quantity of each item in stock.
- The **second column** stores the price per unit of each item.

Write a program to:

1. Ask the user how many items are in the shop (`n`).
2. Input the quantity and price for each item.
3. Print a table displaying:
   - The item's quantity, price per unit, and total value (quantity × price).

## **Exercise 4: Road Trip Fuel Costs**

**Problem Statement:**  
You are given a matrix `trips[n][2]`, where:

- The **first column** stores the distance (in kilometers) traveled on each trip.
- The **second column** stores the fuel consumption (in liters per 100 kilometers).

Write a program to:

1. Ask the user how many trips are planned (`n`).
2. For each trip, input the distance and fuel consumption.
3. Calculate and print a summary table showing:
   - Each trip's distance, fuel consumption rate, and total fuel needed (`distance × fuel consumption / 100`).
4. Calculate and display the total fuel needed for all trips combined.
