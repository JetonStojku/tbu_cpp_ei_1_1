# Exercise

**Exercise 1**
Build a program that asks the user how many rectangles they will input. Then, for each rectangle, ask for its two sides and print the area of the largest rectangle and the index of that rectangle.  

**Exercise 2**
Build a program that asks the user how many rectangles they will input. Then, for each rectangle, ask for its two sides and print the perimeter of the smallest rectangle and the index of that rectangle.  

**Exercise 3**
Build a program that asks the user how many rectangles they will input. Then, for each rectangle, ask for its two sides and print the area of all rectangles that are squares (where the two sides are equal).  

**Exercise 4**
Build a program that asks the user how many rectangles they will input. Then, for each rectangle, ask for its two sides and print the total sum of the areas of all rectangles.  

**Exercise 5**
Build a program that asks the user how many rectangles they will input. Then, for each rectangle, ask for its two sides and print the number of rectangles that have a perimeter greater than 20.  

**Exercise 6**
Build a program that asks the user how many rectangles they will input. Then, for each rectangle, ask for its two sides and print the rectangle with the smallest area and its index.
